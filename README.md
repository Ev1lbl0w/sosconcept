# SOS Concept
Shadows of Shaema (SOS) Concept

## What is this?

This is a small project to test a concept/idea for [Shadows of Shaema](http://github.com/shaema). The concept being mainly the blending of 3D and 2D mechanic.

It's a very early concept, and is currently WIP. The push to Github was for easier code sharing and access.

## Compiling

The project runs under [jMonkeyEngine](http://jmonkeyengine.org/). You need JDK (>1.8) and Ant to compile. Just run this command:

`ant [build.xml]`

And the project is built under `dist/`.

**WARNING** - The project currently won't run because it's lacking some assets. These we're omitted due to possible copyrigth infringements. I'm on the process of getting open-source and free assets so people can run this project.
